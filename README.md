# evosim
Evolution simulator

First version of an evolution simulator
- Grazers on a field of grassy tiles
- Grazers have five traits (exploring, protective, sexual, oppurtunistic, greedy)
- Grazers can move, eat, reproduce
- Reproducing requires a male and a female grazers; the female grazer becomes pregnant and then gives birth
- The child inherits traits from both parents, plus random variation (mutation ?)
- There is a notion of seasons (sine function for grass growth); current setting leads to mass starvations in winter
- Grid size can be adjusted

Feel free to play around with this, let me know what you think and make !
